This year’s Devcon is special in many ways. We’ve used the last three years to create a whole new experience based on all that we’ve seen at past Devcons, and lessons learned while event-planning during the pandemic. Devcon VI involved the community via [Community Hubs](https://forum.devcon.org/c/community-hubs/15) and [Devcon Improvement Proposals](https://forum.devcon.org/c/dip-discussion/6) (DIPs), features a **Public Goods Supporters** Program that relaces a traditional sponsorship effort, and will introduce **Impact Booths** in Bogotá.
