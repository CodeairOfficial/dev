title: "AION: Connecting Blockchains over a Common Fabric"
description: "Mainstream adoption of blockchain technology in the enterprise ecosystem has been impeded due to inherent limitations of scaling individual blockchain networks. We are introducing AION – a multi-tiered blockchain system designed to address some of these core challenges. Core to our hypothesis is the idea that many blockchains will be created to solve unique business challenges, within unique industries. As such, the AION Network is designed to support many custom blockchain architectures, while providing a trustless mechanism for cross-chain interoperability. By utilizing our concept of “bridges”, this multi-tiered blockchain model will allow the creation of layers of connecting blockchain networks that are able to communicate and transact among each other."
