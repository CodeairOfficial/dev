title: "How to Integrate Diverse Sources of Reputational Evidence: Learnings from the Lens Protocol Reputation System"
description: "Machine learning is typically a compute-intensive task that is prohibitively expensive to do on-chain. In this talk I’ll discuss strategies that Aave and the Lens API have used for training and deploying machine learning models in a way that maintains the transparent and trustless ethos of web3. I’ll also cover how we developed some of the models used in the Lens API and how to contribute your own models to the Lens ecosystem."
