title: "The State of Fiat On-Ramps for Layer 2s"
description: "While layer 2s have seen widescale adoption, they are often less accessible for those users that don't have crypto yet. 

In this talk, Thijs Maas, the CEO of Onramper, shall share unique insights into the fiat on-ramp market for layer 2s, using unique insights we get as aggregator. We shall demonstrate the gaps in current layer 2 on-ramp coverage (and it's impact), and give insight into the actual performance of layer 2 on-ramps. Spoiler: things are less rosy than they might seem..."
