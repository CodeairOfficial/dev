title: "The Promise of Trusted Compute for Ethereum Scalability, Decentralization and Privacy"
description: "The Ethereum community has well known reservations about Trusted Compute and support those concerns. As Ethereum is becoming the dominant chain, scalability, decentralization and privacy will be the most important challenges. With the emergence of technologies such as PoS, Plasma and increasing use of staking and voting as design tenets, we believe Trusted Compute designed and deployed with decentralization as the objective can play a significant supporting role in not only preserving but also extending and democratizing the promise of decentralization. The presentation and related demonstrations are designed to engage with and trigger conversations within the Ethereum  community on the relevance of Trusted Compute."
