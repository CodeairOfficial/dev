title: "Introducing Pantheon, a Mainnet Java Client - Demo & Roadmap"
description: "This will be the launch of Pantheon, a Java client built for mainnet with an eye for meeting enterprise requirements. Having multiple, performant clients is important to the long-term viability of the Ethereum ecosystem, and enterprise adoption will draw greater resources. This will be a demo of the new client with a walk-through of our roadmap. By introducing a client in Java and building it open source, weâ€™re hoping to draw in the massive Java community into the Ethereum ecosystem, support research and innovation led by the Ethereum Foundation, and add extensions to meet enterprise needs on privacy, permissioning, and others. We will also talk about some of our research efforts on top of Pantheon."
