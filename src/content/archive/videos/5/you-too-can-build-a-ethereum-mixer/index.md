title: "You Too Can Build a Ethereum Mixer!"
description: "Cryptography is maths, and maths is scary. There's information overload, you don't know where you start, there's smarter people telling you how your solution(s) isn't perfect and how it has a theoretical limit / flaw / weakness, and how it's not \"safe\" to do xyz.So how can one with no academic background in cryptography start building cryptographic protocols to be then ultilized in higher-level applications? This talk will focus on my anecdotal process of building a Heiswap, Ethereum Mixer, with a Research vs Engineering perspective."
