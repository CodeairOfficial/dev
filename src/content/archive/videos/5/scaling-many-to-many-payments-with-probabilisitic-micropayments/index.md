title: "Scaling Many to Many Payments with Probabilisitic Micropayments"
description: "Probabilistic Micropayments, in which a sender pays a recipient with a form of lottery ticket for services performed, present an alternative payment scaling solution to state channels that bring advantages in certain use cases such as stream data processing and distributed compute. In this talk we'll present an overview of this form of micropayments, compare and contrast them to hub and spoke payment channels, show the security model against double-spends, present benchmarks from real world usage within the Livepeer protocol, and showcase an open source implementation."
