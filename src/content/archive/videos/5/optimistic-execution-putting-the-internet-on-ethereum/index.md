title: "Optimistic Execution: Putting the Internet on Ethereum"
description: "Ethereum can serve as an arbiter of trust for the entire internet. To make this a reality we'll have to scale. Our best bet to scale is constructing a comprehensive layer 2.What do plasma, state channels, optimistic rollup, & ETH2 have in common? Optimistic execution! Or in other words, they each make inferences about future Ethereum state based on local information--think fork choice on top of a state machine. Using this concept we construct the Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM), baking inference logic directly into wallet & application software.Â In this talk we discuss how the key role trust will play in the internet--from DeFi to timestamping--and how we can build the underlying infrastructure to support internet scale.
These are exciting times for blockchain infrastructure. Now we just need to solve identity & UBI -- easy!"
