However, when 99% of the users interact with the blockchain, one critical problem shows up: the dApp servers / NSPs are centralized! In this talk, we propose a solution for the future of Web3: an End-to-End Fully Trustless Decentralized Web, which means that any components in our Web2 from the user side and server side will be decentralized in Web3.",

Sadly, this factor preeminently causes these same people to never be able to break out of poverty.\r\n\r\nUnbanked farmers fall in the same boat. Due to their lack of collateral and credit history, they can only access loans starting at 100% interest rate. Crypto and blockchain has an opportunity to change that for the better.",
